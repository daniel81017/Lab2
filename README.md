This site builds off Lab 1 by visualizing the GeoJSON file in Mapbox. Using the basemap I created that has an emphasis on commercial areas (which I am mapping) and a darker greenspace colour, the visual contrast with my created features clearly identifies the Walthamstow High Street area. The black points represent nearby public transport stations and are clickable. Once clicked, the pop-up displays the station name (as inputted in GeoJSON.io, but modified for the Mapbox GL JS sample code referred to at the bottom of my script.js file). The navbar, from Bootstrap, provides helpful resources for those trying to access the area, opening a new tab (via target="_blank") and redirecting users to Transport for London and National Rail sites.
